| 10      | **Covariance vs. Correlation**                   | Covariance measures linear relationships (in units of data), while correlation is a normalized and unitless version.    | Correlation is used when scale-invariant relationships are needed.                                               | Correlation normalizes covariance using standard deviations.                                            | Correlation is preferred for comparisons across datasets, while covariance is useful in PCA.         |
